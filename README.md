# -freeCodeCampProject_Budget-App

The instructions are asking to implement the Category class in the budget.py file. 
For testing the Category class, a main.py file is provided 
which imports the Category class and runs it to check its functionality.

The unit tests for the Category class are provided in the test_module.py file.
These tests are imported in the main.py file for convenience. When the "run" button is clicked in the coding environment, 
the main.py file is executed, which in turn executes the Category class and the unit tests in test_module.py. 
The test results are displayed in the console, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.
